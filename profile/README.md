# CanXP AI

**Sovereign Canadian Artificial Intelligence — built for privacy, precision, and purpose.**  
[https://canxp.ai](https://canxp.ai)

## Our Mission

**CanXP AI** is building the foundation of **Canada’s sovereign AI ecosystem** — ensuring that our models, data, and infrastructure remain in Canadian hands.  
We develop ethical, privacy-first, and energy-efficient language models, tools, and infrastructure to empower researchers, developers, and organizations to build the next generation of Canadian AI.

We believe **AI sovereignty** means more than hosting data locally — it means **owning the models, the methods, and the means of innovation.**

## 🧠 Our Work

### **MaplePT — Canada’s Sovereign Language Model**
A family of instruction-tuned language models trained on Canadian context, law, and culture.  
Built from open architectures like Microsoft Phi-3 and extended with Canadian-specific alignment data.  
- [MaplePT-Mini (v1)](https://huggingface.co/canxp-ai/canxpai-maplept-mini-v1) — open model for research and experimentation  
- [MaplePT vLLM Plugin](https://github.com/CanXPAI/vllm_maplept_plugin) — enables OpenAI-compatible API serving  
- Distributed training infrastructure optimized for **RTX 40/30 series GPUs**, promoting **accessible and sustainable AI research**

## 🧩 Open Technology Stack

Our ecosystem integrates:
- **vLLM** — high-performance inference engine  
- **Supabase** — secure, self-hosted data and API layer  
- **Docker** — portable deployment for on-prem or edge inference  
- **Python / FastAPI / Node.js** — open service frameworks for developers  
- **Hugging Face** — transparent, collaborative model distribution  

## 🌎 Why It Matters

Most AI infrastructure today is foreign-owned and cloud-controlled.  
We’re demonstrating that **real innovation** happens through open research, local collaboration, and responsible resource use - not by funding unnecessary mega-datacenters.

CanXP AI stands for:
- **Sovereignty:** Canadian-controlled models and infrastructure  
- **Accessibility:** AI that runs on consumer-grade hardware  
- **Sustainability:** Efficiency before scale  
- **Transparency:** Open research and reproducible methods  

## 🔬 Research Focus

- Distributed & edge AI training  
- Ethical model alignment and Canadian context adaptation  
- Low-resource fine-tuning and quantization  
- Federated model evaluation  
- Privacy-preserving inference and R&D collaboration  

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome researchers, developers, and organizations who share our vision of **ethical, open, and sovereign AI**.
